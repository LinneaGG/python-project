### Repo for the project for the PhD course: Advanced Scientific Programming with Python

My project is to create a machine learning model to classify passenger survival on the Titanic, and entering the Kaggle competition "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster" (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic). 


For script with results and comments, see `titanic_rf_nb.ipynb`!
